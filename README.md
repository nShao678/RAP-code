# RAP-code

This repo contains the MATLAB code to reproduce (run main.m) the numerical experiments described in [1]. The implementation relies on MATLAB packages [2, 3], which users need to download independently.

Run leadingAngle.m to generate Figure.1 about leading angle.

Run figDD.m to generate Figure.2 about domain decomposition.

Run main.m to generate tables in Section~6.
